                <h2>Lorem</h2>
                <p>Lorem is an adventurous and playful kitten of 5 months. He came to us around Christmas last year and immediately became good friends with our staff and other cats. He grew up with his brothers and sisters, so he is well socialised and friendly. He has tons of energy and requires lots of playtime, meaning he is well-suited as a 
                    work-from-home companion!</p>

                <h2>Ipsum</h2>
                <p>Ipsum is 4 years old and has been with us since last summer. She is shy and enjoys calm, stress-free environments. The first few years of her life were rough, in and out of shelters or on the street. She has lots of spirit and love, but is slower to build trust than most cats. While initially very reluctant towards other cats, Ipsum has been coming out of her shell, even playing with Lorem sometimes! We think someone with 
                    experience would absolutely love having her.</p>

                <h2>Dolor</h2>
                <p>Dolor is our newest family member. He has been blessing us with his calm presence ever since he arrived a few weeks ago. He is around 2 years old and loves cuddling and snacks. His previous family could not keep him, so we're hoping to find him someplace he can stay. He could really use some
                    extra attention from a new family.</p>
